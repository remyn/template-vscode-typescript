# Template Typescript

- Restore the packages

    `npm install`

- Start the compilation on the fly `CTRL SHIFT B` . It will recompile the files each time you save a 'ts' file.

- Tests are using **mocha** and **chai**. They can be written with Typescript. Once compiled, you can run the tests with `npm test`
